        Here‚Äôs why I think designing systems with tools/frameworks like Tachyons
        is a Good Idea‚Ñ¢.

        Design Systems break as they scale (either scaling org or
        scaling product) because new components/variants of a component
        are introduced. Those variants sometimes (read: often) go
        undocumented, leading to duplication when that
        component/variant is needed (and created) again. Even when the
        component is documented, documenting effectively often means
        dozens/hundreds of instances to capture all states/variants.
        Systems like Tachyons et al. approach this problem by instead
        documenting and limiting *properties* of components. (I like
        to think of this as ‚Äúsubatomic‚Äù design.)
      </p>
      <p className="fl w-100 w-50-l mh0 mt0 pl0 pl3-l measure lh-copy f5 f4-l">
        You then create
        components by composing subatomic components (properties).
        Rather than creating a component and its variants, you simply
        have a comprehensive list of ‚Äúingredient‚Äù subatomic components.
        Those subatomic components can be combined in thousands of ways
        to create hundreds of components. The properties of those
        components are numerous, but constrained to a set of acceptable
        values (our subatomic components).‚Äù

        One of the comments I hear most frequently about Zarf‚Äôs design is ‚ÄòI love the minimalism!‚Äô Zarf‚Äôs
        minimalist
        experience is completely powered by Tachyons. With Tachyons, I was able to build a product with a
        cohesive
        design story with minimal hassle and debugging. Tachyons truly made developing the design for Zarf fun.

        As a front-end developer turned full-stack developer, I

        Tachyons is powerful, obvious, and well documented. It‚Äôs made me rethink my approach to building
